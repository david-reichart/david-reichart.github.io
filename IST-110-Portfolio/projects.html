                            Software engineering seems more to be a discipline that Computer Science degrees are aimed for, however, this discussion helped to reassure me that information science and technology is also a more than fitting degree path for that career goal.

                            In this group project, my team and I investigated the impact of information overload on decision making.

                            As someone who has quite a challenging time in making decisions by default, the overabundance of information easily accessible today was nothing new to me. However, I had not thought of how it impacts things such as the environment so greatly until I had researched for this activity.

                            In this discussion, I translated binary code into strings of ASCII text using an ASCII table and reflected on the significance of binary itself.

                            Binary code is something I was well aware of, but only in terms of how numbers are represented. It was especially interesting getting to see how characters are coded and decoded

                            Powers of two are a common thing in technology and development, and this activity showed me exactly why that is since fundamentally there are only two states a transistor can be in.

                            I found prescriptive data analytics to be the most challenging concept to grasp, however, my peers helped me to bridge the gaps in my understanding to form a good foundation in all three concepts.

                            Linux is an operating system I've wanted to get into for quite some time now. After sitting down and reading through the multiple distros available, I feel more confident in my abilities to finally tackle that project and add a second OS to my repertoire.

                            I've used a few programming languages before, but it was useful to research more about the C language specifically. C++ is a language I am currently working on betting myself in, and it is often described as a "superset" of C, so I will certainly be able to put this research to use.

                            Comparing how Python accomplishes print statements next to a language like C++ or C# makes me understand immediately why it's seen as the go to beginner language. Even something like type casting felt very natural. Should I find the use case or time, I will have to dive further in.

                            I've some background in music theory, so it was surprising to me to see the level of depth that Pandora goes to when categorizing their songs. I do wonder more about exactly how they come to the categorization conclusions that they do, because they seem surprisingly accurate even on lesser viewed songs.

                            SQL is immensely useful when learning how to solve problems programmatically. I've found that even in languages far removed from database-oriented languages like SQL, it teaches very universal thought concepts in programming.

                            For most people the terms are interchangable, and I personally think that's a fine thing.

                            This helped to lay some groundwork in the structure building component of web design. Something that I've used to help make this very web page.

                            In this activity, I learned introductory JavaScript to learn how to add interactivity to webpages.

                            With how capable it is, JavaScript is something I view less as a web based technology and more like a general purpose lanauge like Python or C++. Though there's no question that the web is this language's wheelhouse and adds much needed interactivity for what we come to expect from the web.

                            In this group project, my team and I designed an infographic aimed at informing a wide audience of digital security and its importance.

                            I do wish more people would work to make an infographic like the one my team and I made here. Digital security impacts everyone every day and even small changes in habit or additions to security measures could help to secure people's lives more that they likely realize.

                            In this discussion, I investigated how much exactly we interact with databases in our daily lives without realizing it.

                            When I sat down to think and research for this discussion, I was pretty overwhelmed. It made me feel as though even the most innocuous of actions taken on the web were likely being analyzed and stored in some way or form with complete transparency to me the user.

                            In this activity, I reviewed google's data and privacy section to see how much of my personal information is being collected by companies on the web.

                            From what I saw, Google was almost spot on with my demographics and interests. What was particularly surprising was to see how they had predicted - fairly accuratly - my current income, housing status, and working industry. Though I suppose I shouldn't be entirely surprised to see they presume I work in tech when I research as much as I do about programming.

                            I viewed cybercrime to be a near parallel to "traditional" crime. It was a useful change of pace to explore the philosophical side of technology in this specific way. Prior to this, I had thought more so about ethics of data rather than ethics of criminal justice.

                            It seems like there isn't an industry out there that couldn't benefit from information technology integration. I'd not normally think of a pizza chain or tire company as "high-tech", though it turns out they both have a lot more in common with the likes of Apple than I initially thought.
