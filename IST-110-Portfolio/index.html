                    I am a student at Penn State studying Information Science and technology with aspirations of entering the technology industry with a focus on software engineering.
                    My first experiences with computers were just before broadband internet connections permitted folks to use their telephones and computers at the same time.
                    It wasn't much time before I opened up the large desktops, initially out of nothing more than curiosity.
                    Then, a short time later, I found myself making attempts to modify the video games that took much of my young attention.
                    All the while, I had no awareness that these types of tinkering could be taken to the professional world.<br><br>
                    Information science and technology seemed to be the perfect mix of programming and general understanding of technology systems.
                    Through this course, IST 110, I was given a broad reaching overview of the IT field which reaffirmed that assumption.
                    While a number of "hard" skills were explained, I was pleased to be introduced to more people-centric ideas and philosophies on the tech industry throughout my time in this class.<br><br>

                    From Python and JavaScript to criminal justice, you can take a look through the numerous projects and discussions that introduced me to the field of information science and technology <a href="projects.html">right here</a>. These projects have helped reinforce pre-existing skills that I have in programming while also introducing me to a more acedemic style of learning in the field of technology.
