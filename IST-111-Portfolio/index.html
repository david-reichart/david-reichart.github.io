                    <h2 class="sub-header">Who I am</h2>
                    <p>I’m a passionate tech enthusiast with an eye towards the tools of the past, present, and future
                        used to create and distribute all manner of technological products, from entertainment to business
                        functionality.</p>

                    <h2 class="sub-header">Some of my experiences</h2>
                    <p>I have a firm grasp on the fundamentals of information technology hardware; be it troubleshooting
                        on the software or hardware level, building/repairing desktop, laptop, or server computers,
                        installing and configuring basic network infrastructure, and teaching less tech-savvy folks on
                        efficient and proper usage of computing technology.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, I have experience with numerous programming languages including C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        Java, and C++. Of these languages, I’ve a particular affinity for C#. Though I’m far from dead set on those languages, I’m always
                        on the lookout for a new syntactical experience and am very willing to delve into whatever language a
                        project needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Also, with over five years of experience working in the service industry, I’ve plenty of experience
                        working successfully with just about every personality you can think of. Behind every product or service,
                        there simply must be a team of empathetic, driven, and honest individuals if you want the best results,
                        and I feel like I can meet those expectations in any group configuration.</p>

                    <h2 class="sub-header">What I'm interested in</h2>
                    <p>Programming – at least if you’re asking about my number one interest. I’m particularly interested
                        in game development, as it combines so many skills in mathematics, physics, psychology, and art
                        and manages to use logical processes to deliver an experience to users unlike any other form of
                        entertainment. It’s perhaps the perfect blend of art and science.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>That’s not to say I’m disinterested in other application development projects. Where would we be
                        without the tools used to edit photos, videos, 3-D models, or scripts? Being a part of the development
                        team behind such applications would bring me great joy in knowing I helped enable passionate folks
                        to express and communicate.</p>
